        <h1>Teaching</h1>
	<h2>UNL</h2>
	<p>In Fall 2025, I am teaching Math 435: Math in the City. The topic is the math of gerrymandering and congressional redistricting. If you're an enrolled student, you can find our <a href="https://canvas.unl.edu/courses/203202">Canvas page here</a>.</p>
        <p>In Fall 2025, I'm also co-organizing <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/cohomologyclub/home">cohomology club</a>.</p>

<p>In Spring 2026, I will be teaching Math 918: Topics in Commutative Algebra. Here is the <a href="Files/math-918_spring-2026_f-singularities.pdf">course announcement</a>.</p>
	<h2>UM</h2>
	<p>I was often a graduate student instructor (GSI) in the intro program at UM. I also earned my <a href="https://crlt.umich.edu/um.gtc/introduction_to_program">Graduate Teaching Certificate</a>. This was a professional development program for GSIs. My project for the mentorship component was to create exam reflection worksheets for my students, to help them think about how to improve for future exams. Samples are available: [<a href="Files/calc-1-sample-exam-reflection.pdf">pdf</a>] [<a href="calc-1-sample-exam-reflection.docx">docx</a>]</p>

	<h2>Cornell</h2>
        <p>During my undergrad at Cornell, I was an undergrad TA in the Computer Science department. For these courses, I graded and held office hours.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>TA for <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4820/2018sp/">CS 4820</a> (Intro to Analysis of Algorithms): Spring 2017, Fall 2017, Spring 2018</li>

        </p>
        <p>From Fall 2020 through Spring 2024, I was a mentor for <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/twoples">Twoples</a>, a virtual Directed Reading Program.  
        I ran reading projects on intro algorithm design (twice!), random algorithms, probabilistic methods, matroids, Gr&#246;bner bases, algebraic curves, and Young tableaux.</p>
        <p>During Summer 2018, I co-designed and co-taught a 1-week course on network flows at <a href="https://www.mathpath.org/">MathPath</a>, a math camp for middle schoolers.</p>
        <!--- <p>In Spring 2016, I helped virtually teach math education students in the Philippines as part of the Cornell Math Club</p> -->
