        <h1>Teaching</h1>
	<h2>UNL</h2>
	<p>In Fall 2025, I will be teaching Math 435: Math in the City. The topic will be the math of gerrymandering. Check back for more info closer to the start of the semester!</p>
        <p>In Fall 2025, I'm also helping to co-organize <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/cohomologyclub/home">cohomology club</a>.</p>
	<h2>UM</h2>
	<p>I was often a graduate student instructor (GSI) in the intro program at UM. I also earned my <a href="https://crlt.umich.edu/um.gtc/introduction_to_program">Graduate Teaching Certificate</a>. This was a professional development program for GSIs.</p>
        <ul>
		<li>Grad Student Mentor: Fall 2022</li>
		<ul><li>This was an instructor support position. It included providing observations &amp; feedback for new instructors, assisting with teaching team organization, and substitute teaching for the Precalc, Calc 1, and Calc 2 courses.</li></ul>
		<li>Lead instructor for Math Level 3 (prep for Calculus II) at the <a href="https://www.mstem.umich.edu">M-STEM Academies</a>: Summer 2022, Summer 2023</li>
            <li>Grad Co-coordinator for <a href="http://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/courses/115">Math 115</a> (Calculus I): Fall 2021</li>
	    <ul><li>Along with two faculty members, I designed group homework assignments and exams for the course, as well as providing new instructor support by way of observations, feedback, and helping to plan instructional team meetings.</li></ul>
            <li>GSI for <a href="http://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/courses/115">Math 115</a> (Calculus I): Fall 2018, Winter 2019, Winter 2020, Fall 2020, Fall 2023, Winter 2024</li>
            <li>GSI for <a href="http://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/courses/116">Math 116</a> (Calculus II): Fall 2019</li>
        </ul>
	<h2>Cornell</h2>
        <p>During my undergrad at Cornell, I was an undergrad TA in the Computer Science department. For these courses, I graded and held office hours.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>TA for <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4820/2018sp/">CS 4820</a> (Intro to Analysis of Algorithms): Spring 2017, Fall 2017, Spring 2018</li>
            <li>TA for <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110/2016fa">CS 1110</a> (Intro to Programming in Python): Spring 2015, Fall 2015, Spring 2016, Fall 2016</li>
        </ul>
<h1>Mentoring</h1>
        <p>In Winter 2022, I was a grad mentor for <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/research-and-career-opportunities/LoGM.html">LoG(M)</a>.
        </p>
        <p>From Fall 2020 through Spring 2024, I was a mentor for <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/twoples">Twoples</a>, a virtual Directed Reading Program.  
        I ran reading projects on intro algorithm design (twice!), random algorithms, probabilistic methods, matroids, Gr&#246;bner bases, algebraic curves, and Young tableaux.</p>
        <p>During Summer 2018, I co-designed and co-taught a 1-week course on network flows at <a href="https://www.mathpath.org/">MathPath</a>, a math camp for middle schoolers.</p>
        <!--- <p>In Spring 2016, I helped virtually teach math education students in the Philippines as part of the Cornell Math Club</p> -->
