    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Info about yourself! Remember to include your affiliation (and probably advisor and what year you are). Here's a sample link to the UNL <a href="https://math.unl.edu">Math Department</a>. Notice that the url goes inside the "a" tag, and the text you want visible is between the open and close "a" tag.</p>
    <p>For a new paragraph, use a new "p" tag. Below is a sample image. Notice I need to include a "source" (i.e., where to find the image in the directory". Here, Media/selfie.jpg means that there's a subfolder called Media, and my picture is inside that folder.), some alt text, and a width and height that I manually specify, but which are indeed equal to the actual dimensions of the photo..</p>
    <img src="Media/selfie.jpg" alt="Some alt text. Briefly describe photo." width="400" height="294">
