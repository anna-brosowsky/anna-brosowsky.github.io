<h1>Let's Learn Lean!</h1>
<p>Meetings will be <b>Tuesdays 2:30-3:30pm in Avery 351</b>. We will have a hybrid option for those who are interested but unable to attend in person. The zoom link is the same every week and will be sent in the mailing list. Ask me or Zach Norwood to be added to the mailing list; or seach for lean-learning-league on <a href="https://mailman.nebraska.edu/mailman3/lists/">mailman</a> and add yourself!</p>

<h2>Upcoming</h2>
<p>Homework for Jan 27th: Read <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/C01_Introduction.html">Ch1 of Mathematics in Lean</a>. This chapter is short, BUT reading it includes making sure you can get yourself access to Lean! In particular, you should do the following 4 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install Lean4 itself.</li>
<li>Install VSCode (the recommended editor).</li>
<li>Clone the MIL (Math in Lean) repository to get copies of all of the exercises/demos that go along with the book.</li>
<li>Check that everything is working correctly by actually opening the S01 and S02 files in VSCode, and making sure the output in the righthand sidebar looks correct/no errors. (I had to "restart" my files by clicking the &forall; symbol above the code window and using the dropdown menu).
</ul>
<p>There is supposedly a web version of lean available at <a href="https://live.lean-lang.org/">https://live.lean-lang.org/</a>. 
I haven't looked into it too much myself, but if anyone is interested and gets it working then we'd love for you to help people troubleshoot. (In particular, the stumbling block at which I gave up was figuring out how to get the MIL imports to work in order to get exercise S02 to be error-free).</p>
<p>If you finish all that and want more to do... Ayden discovered <a href="https://adam.math.hhu.de/">even more lean games</a> on the same server. So you can keep playing the natural number game, or try out real analysis, set theory, or linear algebra.</p>


<h2>Past Meetings</h2>

    <dt>Jan 20th</dt>
    <dd>We played the <a href="https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/nng4">natural number game</a> to start to get familiar with the syntax and key ideas. You can set rules to "relaxed" to skip ahead to later levels, but the goal was really just to do Tutorial World and Addition World (in particular, to mess around with induction!). 
We saw a mini-preview of what actual lean code would look like. We also discussed our goals for the semester: have fun, and see what doing lean "in practice" would look like! How could we code an actual small theorem? How could we contribute to the open source project? Finally, here are <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/100-missing.html">17 theorems not yet formalized in lean</a>.</dd>
