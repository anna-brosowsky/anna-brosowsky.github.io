    <p><b>Big Assumptions</b> (for all semester!): p = a prime number; q = a power of p; all rings are unital, commutative, and noetherian. For a very long time (up until reduction to char p), all rings are characteristic p.</p>
    <p>We covered the beginning of Ch 1 of [CdS], up through and including Remark 1.8. (See also very first section of [MP].) <em>Useful fact:</em> In a reduced (char p) ring, when p-th roots exist, they are unique!</p>
    <p>We also concretely looked at $R^{1/p}$ and $F_*R$ in the concrete example where $R=\mathbb F_2[x]$, and saw how these are generated (as $R$-modules) by $\{1,\sqrt x\}$ and $\{1,F_*x\}$, respectively. 
    We saw more generally that when $R= \mathbb F_p[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$, that $F_*R$ is generated by $\{F_*(x_1^{a_1}\cdots x_d^{a_d})\: | \: 0\leq a_i \lt p\}$. 
    We even saw that this generating set is actually a basis! Finally, the following commutative diagram showed us that all three perspectives are really "the same" map. 
    Note that all vertical maps are isomorphisms/equalities, the horizontal maps are all different ways of writing the Frobenius, and the whole bottom row only makes sense when $R$ is reduced.</p>

    <p>Defined a separable polynomial and a perfect field (Ref: Section 15.5 of <a href="https://eloisagrifo.github.io/Teaching/algebra.pdf">Eloi&#769;sa's Math 818 notes</a>). 
    In particular, a char $p$ field is perfect if and only if $F$ is a surjection. $K=\mathbb F_p(T)$ is a non-perfect field example. We stated #5 below as a bonus problem (but originally stated it wrong! I meant to say $R^p$ not $R^{1/p}$, my apologies). </p>
    <p>We then worked for a while on questions #1-4, and went over the answers to #1-3:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Describe the $R$-module structure of $F_*R$ when $R=\mathbb F_p[x,y]/\langle xy\rangle$.
        <button type="button" class="viewsoln">View Solution</button>
        <div class="soln">
            <p> Generators are $\{F_*x^i, F_*y^i\: | \: 0\le i \lt p\}$. I.e., the same as for the polynomial ring, but we remove all the ones corresponding to the cross terms that are already zero in this quotient ring.</p>
            <p> Relations are $yF_*x^i = 0$ and $xF_*y^i=0$.</p>
        </div>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the $R$-module structure of $F_*R$ when $R=\mathbb F_2[x^2,x^3]\subset \mathbb F_2[x]$.
        <button type="button" class="viewsoln">View Solution</button>
        <div class="soln">
            <p> Generators are $\{F_*1, F_*x^2, F_*x^3, F_*x^5\}$. Notice that the monomials in $R$ are every power of $x$ EXCEPT for $x$ itself. So via taking $x^aF_*x^b = F_*x^{2a+b}$ for $b\in \{0,2,3,5\}$, we see that even just $F_*x^{2a+2}$ and $F_*x^{2a+3}$ cover all possible powers $\ge 6$. The only other seemingly missing monomial is $F_*x^4$, but $F_*x^4 = x^2F_*1$.</p>
            <p> Relations are &nbsp; 
            $\begin{aligned} x^3F_*1 &amp;= x^2 F_*x^2 &amp; x^3F_*x^3 &amp;= x^2F_*x^5 \\ x^4F_*1 &amp;= x^3F_*x^2 &amp; x^4F_*x^3 &amp;= x^3F_*x^5\end{aligned}$.</p>
        </div>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the $R$-module structure of $F_*R$ when $R=\mathbb F_3[x,y]/\langle y^2-x^3-x\rangle$.
        <button type="button" class="viewsoln">View Solution</button>
        <div class="soln">
            <p> Generators are $\{F_*1,F_*x,F_*y\}$. Clearly the 9 monomials $\{F_*x^iy^j\: | \: 0\le i,j\lt 3\}$ would suffice as a generating set, so now we'll show that the other 6 of them are actually redundant via taking multiples of our defining equation. 
            As we go down the list, we will only use higher up monomials to get the lower ones.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li> $F_*y^2 = xF_*1 + F_*x$ (via original equation)</li>
                  <li> $F_*xy  = yF_*1 - xF_*y$ (via $\cdot y$)</li>
                  <li> $F_*xy^2 = yF_*y - xF_*y^2$ (via $\cdot y^2$)</li>
                  <li> $F_*x^2 = F_*xy^2 - xF_*x$ (via $\cdot x$)</li>
                  <li> $F_*x^2y^2 = xF_*x^2 + xF_*1$ (via $\cdot x^2$)</li>
                  <li> $F_*x^2y = yF_*x - xF_*xy$ (via $\cdot xy$)</li>
                </ul>
            <p>There are no relations! </p>
        </div>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the $R$-module structure of $F_*R$ when $R=\mathbb F_p(T)[x]$.
        <button type="button" class="viewsoln">View Solution</button>
        <div class="soln">
            <p>Generators are $\{F_*(T^jx^i)\: | \: 0\le i,j\lt p\}$. No relations!</p>
            <p>Notice that $TF_*x^i = F_*(T^px^i)$. So if we had only used the generators from the perfect field case, we would be missing being able to write an element like $F_*T$. Or said another way, previously in the perfect case we knew that if we wanted to write $F_*(ax)$, we could always pull out the $a$ via taking a $p$-th root, so that $F_*(ax) = a^{1/p}F_*x$. But if the Frobenius isn't surjective, we can't do that anymore!</p>
        </div>
        </li>
        <li>Give an example of a ring $R$ where $R^{p}$ is NOT isomorphic to $F_*R$. In other words, an example where the inclusion $R^p\hookrightarrow R$ is NOT the same map as the Frobenius. [Corrected typo from earlier statement: I wanted $R^p$ not $R^{1/p}$!]</li>
    </ol>

  <p>We then noticed a pattern: drawing the corresponding varieties for the two ``free'' examples gave us affine space (the polynomial ring) and a smooth elliptic curve (#3). Drawing the two ``non-free'' examples gave us two lines crossing (#1) and a cuspidal cubic (#2).</p>
  <div class="defn"><p><b>Definition:</b> The ring $(R,\mathfrak m, k)$ is a  <em>regular local ring</em> if $\dim R = \dim_k \mathfrak m /\mathfrak m^2$. In other words, if the Krull dimension = the embedding dimension.</p><p>A ring $R$ is a <em>regular ring</em> if $R_{\mathfrak m}$ is a regular local ring for every maximal ideal $\mathfrak m$.</p></div>
  <p>You will eventually learn a lot more about regular rings in Math 906.</p>
  <div class="thm"><p><b>Kunz's Theorem:</b> $R$ is regular if and only if the Frobenius is flat.</p></div>
  <div class="defn"><p><b>Definition:</b> $R$ is <em>$F$-finite</em> if $F_*R$ is a finitely generated $R$-module.</p></div>
  <p>For a local ring and a finitely generated module $M$, you already know that $M$ is flat if and only if it is free. This and our new definition give us an immediate corollary to Kunz.</p>
  <div class="thm"><p><b>Corollary:</b> Let $(R,\mathfrak m)$ be an $F$-finite local ring. Then $R$ is regular if and only if $F_*R$ is free.</p></div>


<h3 id="upcoming">Upcoming</h3>
    <p>Up next is to finish Ch 1 of [MP]; roughly equivalently, Rmk 1.10 of [CdS] then move on to Ch 2 of [CdS]. (We'll be skipping the integral &amp; tight closure for now but it will return later in the semester!)</p>
<p>First we'll see the answer to #4 (and maybe #5?) above. Then we'll work towards proving Kunz's theorem! 
To do this, we'll end up defining completions and stating Cohen's structure theorem, proving that $F_*$ is an exact functor and commutes with localization (Prop 1.10 of [CdS]), and then finally proving the theorem.
<!--  via "Lech independence" (the version of the proof in [CdS]). If you know more about regular rings (including what a regular sequence is), you might enjoy reading the alternate homological version of the proof in [MP].-->
