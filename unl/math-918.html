    <p><b>Big Assumptions</b> (for all semester!): p = a prime number; q = a power of p; all rings are unital, commutative, and noetherian. For a very long time (up until reduction to char p), all rings are characteristic p.</p>
    <p>We covered the beginning of Ch 1 of [CdS], up through and including Remark 1.8. (See also very first section of [MP].) <em>Useful fact:</em> In a reduced (char p) ring, when p-th roots exist, they are unique!</p>
    <p>We also concretely looked at $R^{1/p}$ and $F_*R$ in the concrete example where $R=\mathbb F_2[x]$, and saw how these are generated (as $R$-modules) by $\{1,\sqrt x\}$ and $\{1,F_*x\}$, respectively. 
    We saw more generally that when $R= \mathbb F_p[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$, that $F_*R$ is generated by $\{F_*(x_1^{a_1}\cdots x_d^{a_d})\: | \: 0\leq a_i \lt p\}$. 
    We even saw that this generating set is actually a basis! Finally, the following commutative diagram showed us that all three perspectives are really "the same" map. 
    Note that all vertical maps are isomorphisms/equalities, the horizontal maps are all different ways of writing the Frobenius, and the whole bottom row only makes sense when $R$ is reduced.</p>

    <p>Defined a separable polynomial and a perfect field (Ref: Section 15.5 of <a href="https://eloisagrifo.github.io/Teaching/algebra.pdf">Eloi&#769;sa's Math 818 notes</a>). 
    In particular, a char $p$ field is perfect if and only if $F$ is a surjection. $K=\mathbb F_p(T)$ is a non-perfect field example. We stated #5 below as a bonus problem (but originally stated it wrong! I meant to say $R^p$ not $R^{1/p}$, my apologies). </p>
    <p>We then worked for a while on questions #1-4, and went over the answers to #1-3:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Describe the $R$-module structure of $F_*R$ when $R=\mathbb F_p[x,y]/\langle xy\rangle$.
        <button type="button" class="viewsoln">View Solution</button>
        <div class="soln">
            <p> Generators are $\{F_*x^i, F_*y^i\: | \: 0\le i \lt p\}$. I.e., the same as for the polynomial ring, but we remove all the ones corresponding to the cross terms that are already zero in this quotient ring.</p>
            <p> Relations are $yF_*x^i = 0$ and $xF_*y^i=0$.</p>
        </div>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the $R$-module structure of $F_*R$ when $R=\mathbb F_2[x^2,x^3]\subset \mathbb F_2[x]$.
        <button type="button" class="viewsoln">View Solution</button>
        <div class="soln">
            <p> Generators are $\{F_*1, F_*x^2, F_*x^3, F_*x^5\}$. Notice that the monomials in $R$ are every power of $x$ EXCEPT for $x$ itself. So via taking $x^aF_*x^b = F_*x^{2a+b}$ for $b\in \{0,2,3,5\}$, we see that even just $F_*x^{2a+2}$ and $F_*x^{2a+3}$ cover all possible powers $\ge 6$. The only other seemingly missing monomial is $F_*x^4$, but $F_*x^4 = x^2F_*1$.</p>
            <p> Relations are &nbsp; 
            $\begin{aligned} x^3F_*1 &amp;= x^2 F_*x^2 &amp; x^3F_*x^3 &amp;= x^2F_*x^5 \\ x^4F_*1 &amp;= x^3F_*x^2 &amp; x^4F_*x^3 &amp;= x^3F_*x^5\end{aligned}$.</p>
        </div>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the $R$-module structure of $F_*R$ when $R=\mathbb F_3[x,y]/\langle y^2-x^3-x\rangle$.
        <button type="button" class="viewsoln">View Solution</button>
        <div class="soln">
            <p> Generators are $\{F_*1,F_*x,F_*y\}$. Clearly the 9 monomials $\{F_*x^iy^j\: | \: 0\le i,j\lt 3\}$ would suffice as a generating set, so now we'll show that the other 6 of them are actually redundant via taking multiples of our defining equation. 
            As we go down the list, we will only use higher up monomials to get the lower ones.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li> $F_*y^2 = xF_*1 + F_*x$ (via original equation)</li>
                  <li> $F_*xy  = yF_*1 - xF_*y$ (via $\cdot y$)</li>
                  <li> $F_*xy^2 = yF_*y - xF_*y^2$ (via $\cdot y^2$)</li>
                  <li> $F_*x^2 = F_*xy^2 - xF_*x$ (via $\cdot x$)</li>
                  <li> $F_*x^2y^2 = xF_*x^2 + xF_*1$ (via $\cdot x^2$)</li>
                  <li> $F_*x^2y = yF_*x - xF_*xy$ (via $\cdot xy$)</li>
                </ul>
            <p>There are no relations! </p>
        </div>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the $R$-module structure of $F_*R$ when $R=\mathbb F_p(T)[x]$.
        <button type="button" class="viewsoln">View Solution</button>
        <div class="soln">
            <p>Generators are $\{F_*(T^jx^i)\: | \: 0\le i,j\lt p\}$. No relations!</p>
            <p>Notice that $TF_*x^i = F_*(T^px^i)$. So if we had only used the generators from the perfect field case, we would be missing being able to write an element like $F_*T$. Or said another way, previously in the perfect case we knew that if we wanted to write $F_*(ax)$, we could always pull out the $a$ via taking a $p$-th root, so that $F_*(ax) = a^{1/p}F_*x$. But if the Frobenius isn't surjective, we can't do that anymore!</p>
        </div>
        </li>
        <li>Give an example of a ring $R$ where $R^{p}$ is NOT isomorphic to $F_*R$. In other words, an example where the inclusion $R^p\hookrightarrow R$ is NOT the same map as the Frobenius. [Corrected typo from earlier statement: I wanted $R^p$ not $R^{1/p}$!]</li>
    </ol>

  <p>We then noticed a pattern: drawing the corresponding varieties for the two ``free'' examples gave us affine space (the polynomial ring) and a smooth elliptic curve (#3). Drawing the two ``non-free'' examples gave us two lines crossing (#1) and a cuspidal cubic (#2).</p>
  <div class="defn"><p><b>Definition:</b> The ring $(R,\mathfrak m, k)$ is a  <em>regular local ring</em> if $\dim R = \dim_k \mathfrak m /\mathfrak m^2$. In other words, if the Krull dimension = the embedding dimension.</p><p>A ring $R$ is a <em>regular ring</em> if $R_{\mathfrak m}$ is a regular local ring for every maximal ideal $\mathfrak m$.</p></div>
  <p>You will eventually learn a lot more about regular rings in Math 906.</p>
  <div class="thm"><p><b>Kunz's Theorem:</b> $R$ is regular if and only if the Frobenius is flat.</p></div>
  <div class="defn"><p><b>Definition:</b> $R$ is <em>$F$-finite</em> if $F_*R$ is a finitely generated $R$-module.</p></div>
  <p>For a local ring and a finitely generated module $M$, you already know that $M$ is flat if and only if it is free. This and our new definition give us an immediate corollary to Kunz.</p>
  <div class="thm"><p><b>Corollary:</b> Let $(R,\mathfrak m)$ be an $F$-finite local ring. Then $R$ is regular if and only if $F_*R$ is free.</p></div>

<p>Some facts (that became exercises):</p>
<ol>
<li>
Prove that $F$ induces an isomorphism on Spec.
        <button type="button" class="viewsoln">View Solution</button>
        <div class="soln"><p>The induced map on Spec takes a prime ideal $Q$ to $F^{-1}(Q)$. If $r\in Q$, then $r^p=F(r)\in Q$ and thus $r\in F^{-1}(Q)$. Conversely, if $r\in F^{-1}(Q)$ this means $r^p\in Q$, but $Q$ is prime so $r\in Q$.</p></div>
</li>
<li>Prove that $F_*^e$ is an exact functor. (In particular, we first saw what it does to maps and to modules: just throws an $F_*^e$ decoration in front!)
        <button type="button" class="viewsoln">View Solution</button>
        <div class="soln"><p>See proof of Prop 1.10(1) in [CdS].</p></div>
</li>
<li>If $W\subset R$ is a multiplicative set, then $W^{-1}(F_*^eR)\to F_*^e(W^{-1}R)$ via $\frac{F_*^e r}{w}\mapsto F_*^e(\frac{r}{w^{p^e}})$ is a $W^{-1}R$-module isomorphism.
        <button type="button" class="viewsoln">View Solution</button>
        <div class="soln"><p>See proof of Prop 1.10(2) in [CdS].</p></div>
</li>
</ol>


<div class="defn">
<p><b>Definition:</b> A sequence $(r_n)_{n\in \mathbb N}$in $R^{\mathbb N}$ is <em>Cauchy in the $I$-adic topology</em> if for all $t\in \mathbb N$ there exists a $d\in \mathbb N$ such that for $n,m\geq d$, we have $r_n-r_m\in I^t$.

Let $C_I(R)$ be the set of Cauchy sequences.

Let $C^0_I(R)$ be the sequences convernging to zero, i.e., s.t. for all $n$ there exists $m$ s.t. for all $i\geq m$, $r_i\in I^n$. 
</p></div>

<div class="thm">
<p><b>Facts/Definition:</b> $C_I(R)$ is a ring and $C^0_I(R)$ is an ideal; the completion is $\widehat R^I = C_I/C_I^0$. We're going to only use this for local rings and the $I=\mathfrak m$ case, written just plain $\widehat R$, which satisfies:</p>
<ul>
<li>$\widehat R$ is a local commutative unital noetherian ring</li>

<li>Completion at $\mathfrak m$ is faithfully flat</li>

<li>$R$ is regular if and only if $\widehat R$ is regular.</li>

<li>(Cohen Structure Theorem, equicharacteristic case) Suppose $(R,\mathfrak m,k)$ is a complete local ring containing a field. Then $R\cong k[[ x_1,\ldots, x_n]]/I$. Further, $R$ is regular if and only if $R\cong k[[x_1,\ldots, x_d]]$.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p><em>Proof of regular implies flat</em></p>
<p>$R$ is regular iff $R_Q$ is regular for all $Q$; and a map $\phi$ is flat iff $\phi_Q$ is flat for all $Q$. Further, $F_*^e$ commutes with localization. Thus we reduce to the local case. Now consider</p>
<img src="../Files/unl/01-20_kunz-comm-digr-small.png">
<p>Recall fact: In such a diagram (where both vertical maps are faithfully flat), if the bottom map is flat then so is the top one. So sufficient to show for the complete case, and likewise sufficient to do for a power series ring over an algebraically closed field, but we (basically) already did that! &#8718; 
</p>
<p>We started the proof of the other direction (in the style of [CdS]) but didn't finish; however we did get through the following:</p>
<div class="defn">
<p><b>Definition:</b> 
Let $(R,\mathfrak m)$ local. 
Then $x_1,\ldots, x_n$ is <em>Lech independent</em> if having $a_1x_1+\cdots + a_nx_n=0$ for $a_i\in R$ in fact implies that $a_i \in \langle x_1,\ldots, x_n\rangle$ for all $i$.</p>

<p>Equivalently: letting $\mathfrak q = \langle \underline x\rangle$, they are Lech independent iff they minimally generate $\mathfrak q$ and $\mathfrak q/\mathfrak q^2$ is a free $R/\mathfrak q$-module.
</p>
</div>

<div class="thm">
<p><b>Lech's Lemma:</b> 
Let $(R,\mathfrak m)$ be a local ring and $x_1,\ldots, x_n$ be Lech independent elements which generate an $\mathfrak m$-primary ideal. 
If $x_1=y_1z_1$ then \[\ell_R(R/\langle x_1,\ldots, x_n\rangle)=\ell_R(R/\langle y_1,\ldots, x_n\rangle) + \ell_R(R/\langle z_1,\ldots, x_n\rangle)\]
</p></div>
<p>Proof in Lemma 2.6 of [CdS]</p>

<h3 id="upcoming">Upcoming</h3>
<p>Finish proving Kunz  via "Lech independence" (the version of the proof in [CdS]). If you know more about regular rings (including what a regular sequence is), you might enjoy reading the alternate homological version of the proof in [MP]. Then skip ahead to Ch 2 of [MP] and Ch 5 of [CdS] to define F-splitting.
